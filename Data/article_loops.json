  "Information": "The while loop\nThe simplest kind of loop is the while-loop. Its syntax is:\n\nwhile (expression) statement\n\nThe while-loop simply repeats statement while expression is true. If, after any execution of statement, expression is no longer true, the loop ends, and the program continues right after the loop. For example, let's have a look at a countdown using a while-loop: // custom countdown using while\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main ()\n{\n  int n = 10;\n\n  while (n>0) {\n    cout << n << \", \";\n    --n;\n  }\n\n  cout << \"liftoff!\\n\";\n} The first statement in main sets n to a value of 10. This is the first number in the countdown. Then the while-loop begins: if this value fulfills the condition n>0 (that n is greater than zero), then the block that follows the condition is executed, and repeated for as long as the condition (n>0) remains being true.",
