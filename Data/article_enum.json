  "Information": "Enum is a user defined data type where we specify a set of values for a variable and the variable can only take one out of a small set of possible values. We use enum keyword to define a Enumeration.\n\nenum direction {East, West, North, South}dir;\nHere Enumeration name is direction which can only take one of the four specified values, the dir at the end of the declaration is an enum variable.\n\nLets take a simple example to understand this:\nHere I have assigned the value West to the enum variable dir and when I displayed the value of dir it shows 1. This is because by default the values are in increasing order starting from 0, which means East is 0, West is 1, North is 2 and South is 3.\n\nSimple enum Example\n#include<iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nenum direction {East, West, North, South}dir;\nint main()\n{\n   dir = West;\n   cout<<dir;\n   return 0;\n}\nAnother way to declare enum variable",
