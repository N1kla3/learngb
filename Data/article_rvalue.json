  "Information": "an rvalue denotes an object whose resource can be reused, that is to say a disposable object. This typically includes temporary objects as they canâ€™t be manipulated at the place they are created and are soon to be destroyed. In the expression g(MyClass()) for instance, MyClass() designates a temporary object that g can modify without impacting the code surrounding the expression. And an rvalue reference is a reference that binds to an rvalue. rvalue references are marked with two ampersands (&&).",
