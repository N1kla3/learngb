  "Information": "An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.\n\nThat means that, for example, five values of type int can be declared as an array without having to declare 5 different variables (each with its own identifier). Instead, using an array, the five int values are stored in contiguous memory locations, and all five can be accessed using the same identifier, with the proper index.\n\nFor example, an array containing 5 integer values of type int called foo could be represented as: where each blank panel represents an element of the array. In this case, these are values of type int. These elements are numbered from 0 to 4, being 0 the first and 4 the last; In C++, the first element in an array is always numbered with a zero (not a one), no matter its length.",
